# Cribbage
C++ implementation of the cribbage card game

## About
This is a project developed in early 2017.  The motivation of the project was to understand the average point values of given strategies within the game (see the `/examples` directory). I had written the C++ implementation for a deck of cards in a previous class project, so continuation on C++ was a natural choice.

In the future, I would like to explore different strategies by implementing different strategies and machine learning techniques.  Future work includes writing logic to run entire matches and standardizing how game results are stored.

## Usage
To use the example code, perform the following in the `/examples` directory: 
- Compile using `make` 
- Run the code with `./scoretest` 
- Optionally, run the R script with `Rscript score_stats.r`
